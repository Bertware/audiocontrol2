# Audiocontrol2

This is a central part of HiFiBerryOS that handles multiple concurrent media players.
This is the core controller application of [HiFiBerryOS](https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os), but feel free to use it
any project of your choice.
To work well, all local players should support MPRIS.
